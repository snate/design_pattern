Decorator
==============

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh

The expected outcome of this program is:

> The garden is green and awesome

> I'm the gnome and I ensure that every plant is growing healthy and
  flourishing

> I'm the gardener and I cut every hedgeevery day

You can always add functionalities and make your own tests:

* Adding the same decorator more than once in Client.java
* Subclassing AGardenDecorator in the same way I did for ConcreteGnome and
  ConcreteGardener and adding it to client's code
