Builder
=======

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh

The expected outcome of this program is:

> Nexus 5:
> Operative system: Lollipop 5.1
> Screen size: 4.95 inches
> 
> iPhone 5:
> Operative system: iOS 8.3
> Screen size: 4.0 inches

You can always add functionalities and make your own tests:

* Instantiating twice or more the same type of builder and requiring the
  building process
* Subclassing CellBuilder to create your own phone builder
