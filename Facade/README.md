Facade
======

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh yourstring

Whereas yourstring is any string you want to give as an input.

The expected outcome of this program is:

> gnirtsruoy              % yourstring read from the end to the start

> oui                     % the vocals in yourstring

> yrstrng                 % the consonants in yourstring, ignoring spaces and punctuation

You can always add functionalities and make your own tests:

1. Make some classes in analizer (package)
2. Call their functionalities in analizer.Facade's "void analize()" method
