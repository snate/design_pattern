Adapter
==============

Object Adapter
--------------

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh yourname

Whereas yourname is any string you want to give as an input.

The expected outcome of this program is:

    Hello dear yourname

Class Adapter
--------------

You are required to make a little step to try this version of the pattern,
which behaves in the same way of the __Object Adapter__. The only thing you
have to do is to open adapter/Client.java, remove the // in front of the
Class Adapter commented row and put // at the beginning of the Object Adapter
row.

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh yourname

Whereas yourname is any string you want to give as an input.

The expected outcome of this program is:

    Hello dear yourname
