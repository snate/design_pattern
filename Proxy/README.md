If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh number

Whereas number is a number in range [1,3].

Case 1
------

The expected behaviour of this program is to keep asking to user if he/she
wants to see the image, until he/she answers "y".

Case 2
------

The expected behaviour of this program is to ask for a password in order to
access the RealImage.
Indeed, if you type "__password__", you'll see the real image, otherwise
you'll see an error message.

Case 3
------

The expected behaviour of this program is to count the objects that Client(s)
instantiated and to show this number juxtaposed to the real image.
