If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh

The expected outcome of this program is one of the interleavings of the
following sentences:

> I'm happy. I'm telling you that Microsoft merges with Apple.
> Nothing new. Blah blah blah, but I might say you that population dreads unexpected terrorist attack.
> Hey you. Don't move and stay there, because population dreads unexpected terrorist attack.
> I'm happy. I'm telling you that population dreads unexpected terrorist attack.
> Hey you. Don't move and stay there, because first ships are leaving Earth to start life on Mars.
> Nothing new. Blah blah blah, but I might say you that first ships are leaving Earth to start life on Mars.
> I'm happy. I'm telling you that first ships are leaving Earth to start life on Mars.

> Nothing new. Blah blah blah, but I might say you that Microsoft merges with Apple.


You can always add functionalities and make your own tests:
