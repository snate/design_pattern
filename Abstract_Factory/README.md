Abstract Factory
================

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh

The expected outcome of this program is:

>
> Factory 1: Red factory
> Shirt with a tomato
> Red boots
>
> Factory 2: Blue factory
> Shirt with a sea picture
> Blue loafers
>


You can always add functionalities and make your own tests:

* Subclassing ClothesFactory to implement your own factory (if you want more
  products than the simple four I made, you can create other implementations
  of PairOfShoes and Shirt).
