Strategy
========

If you want to execute the trial program, type:

    bash play.sh


The expected outcome of this program is:

> Ok for InsertionSort

> Ok for HeapSort


You can always add functionalities and make your own tests:

* Implementing another sorter algorithm and requesting it to order a list of
  numbers, then check the outcome with check method in Client class
* Implementing another checker algorithm (in test package) and requesting it
  to check if the outcome of the sorting are correct or not
